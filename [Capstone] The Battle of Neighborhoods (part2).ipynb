Bay Street Corridor neighborhood has the highest floating population in Toronto except St.James Town where its high population is highly concentrated on residents only. In addition, Ramsey's restaurant would have the upper hand compared to other restaurants because Bay Street Corridor is located near variety of food distributors, giving Ramsey's restaurant the ability to get fresh ingredients. When we think about his restaurant's possible competitors, there are Blu Ristorante and Lounge and Sofia. "

As I expected through the neighborhoods' characteristics, the most commmon venues near St.James Town were cafe, gyms, and beer shops as St.James Town is the resident-centered neighborhood. On the other hand, the most commmon venues near Bay Street Corridor were restaurants and clothing shops. From this data analysis, I could derive insights that Bay Street Corrider is the best neighborhood for Ramsey's new itatlian restaurant."
